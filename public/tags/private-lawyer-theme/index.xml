      <description>I was having problems with the Coda Slider in the Private Lawyer Wordpress Theme by Templatic. (The slider is called the T Anything Slider widget by the theme.) Text was being truncated even when the text length was less than the number of characters specified on the widget settings.
A small modification to the bm_better_excerpt function in wp-content/themes/PrivateLaweyer/library/functions/custom_functions.php solves the problem.
File: wp-content/themes/PrivateLaweyer/library/functions/custom_functions.php
&amp;lt;?php // Excerpt length function bm_better_excerpt($length, $ellipsis) { $text = get_the_content(); // // fix weird bug that caused substr to chop // text even if $length was greater than string length if (strlen($text) &amp;gt; $length) { $text = strip_tags($text); $text = substr($text, 0, $length); $text = substr($text, 0, strrpos($text, &amp;#34; &amp;#34;)); $text = $text.</description>
