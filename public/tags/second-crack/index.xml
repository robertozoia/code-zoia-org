      <description>I have just finished the alpha version of Ristretto, a ‘baked’ blogging engine. That is, it&amp;rsquo;s an engine that reads posts written in Markdown and generates static html files.
Ristretto is loosely inspired on Marco Arment’s Second Crack. Some interesting references about why baked blogs are worth considering can be found in A plea for baked blogs, Blogging with Octropress, and Blogging with Second Crack.
Ristretto is written in Python. The alpha version of Ristretto is functional and can be used for daily blogging.</description>
