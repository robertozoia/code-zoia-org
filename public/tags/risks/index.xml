      <description>A quote from _why about experimenting and taking risks, before his disapparition.
 I do not write tests for my code. I do not write very many comments. I change styles very frequently. And most of all, I shun the predominant styles of coding, because that would go against the very essence of experimentation. In short: all I do is muck around.
  So, my way of measuring a great programmer is different from some prevailing thought on the subject.</description>
