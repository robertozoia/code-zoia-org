[TextMate](http://macromates.com/)Â is a great text editor for MacOs.  But the default Python bundle does not recognize Python's virtual environments (`virtualenv`), which is rather annoying.

No need to modify your Textmate bundle.  This can be solved by declaring a project-specific shell variable named `TM_PYTHON` and assigning your virtualenv's custom python's path to it:

*   In TextMate, create a new project for your python program
*   Open the Project Drawer Window (View/Open Project Drawer)
*   Make sure no file is selected in the drawer. Click on the Get-Info icon to open the Project Information Dialog (see picture)
*   Add a variable named `TM_PYTHON` and assign it your virtualenv python path

(Your virtualenv python path can be obtained by typing `which python` in a Terminal window after activating your virtualenv environment with `workon`.)
