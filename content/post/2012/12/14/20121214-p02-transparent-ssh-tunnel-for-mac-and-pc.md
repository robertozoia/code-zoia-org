I use [Sidestep](http://chetansurpur.com/projects/sidestep/) on OSX to build an encrypted connection to a remote server of my own through when connecting to the Internet on public WiFi networks.  But the latest version of SideStep does not work reliably with Mountain Lion.

[TunnelBear](http://tunnelbear.com) offers an alternative, and its free for casual use (up to 500MB monthly).
