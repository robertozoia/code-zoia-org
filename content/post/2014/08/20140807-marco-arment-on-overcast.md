Just finished listening to [Episode 43 of Debug](http://www.imore.com/debug-43-exclusive-marco-arment-breaks-his-silence-overcast), where Guy English and Rene Ritchie interview [Marco Arment](http://marco.org) about the recent launch of Overcast, his podcasting app for iPhone.

The episode is great.  It is around three hours long but worth the time if you are interested in iOS development and the app ecosystem.  Marco explains some of the problems he found while implementing the app and how he solved them, and his product design decisions.
