Just finished watching [_Simple Made Easy_](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy), a talk by Rich Hickey, creator of Clojure, at The Strange Loop 2011 conference. Recommended (1 hour).

We should be simplifying the problem domain, and creating solutions by composing simple parts. Instead, we endure complexity, and pride ourselves in our ability to manage it. We can do better.
