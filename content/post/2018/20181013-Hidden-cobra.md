US-CERT on the [August/September 2018 ATM hacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-275A) which affected several nations:

> (...) all of the compromised switch application servers were running unsupported IBM Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) operating system versions beyond the end of their service pack support dates;

This is the typical example of short-term thinking.  Someone/some comittee decides not to spend on a supported version of a particular software, but don't consider what the downside could be.
