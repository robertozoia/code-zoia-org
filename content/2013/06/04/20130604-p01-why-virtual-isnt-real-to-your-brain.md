Nice article by the lengendary Michael Abrash: [Why virtual isn't real to your brain](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/abrash/why-virtual-isnt-real-to-your-brain/).  Before delving into technical detail, he shares some reflections on how sharing information probably helped him early in his carrier land a job at Microsoft, then Id, and more recently at Valve.
