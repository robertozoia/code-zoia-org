I have just finished the alpha version of _Ristretto_, a ‘baked’ blogging engine.  That is, it's an engine that reads posts written in Markdown and generates static html files.

Ristretto is loosely inspired on Marco Arment’s [Second Crack](https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack).  Some interesting references about why _baked blogs_ are worth considering can be found in [A plea for baked blogs](http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/), [Blogging with Octropress](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/), and [Blogging with Second Crack](http://jeremygibbs.com/2012/02/02/blogging-second-crack).

Ristretto is written in Python.  The alpha version of Ristretto is functional and can be used for daily blogging.  I am using it for both this blog (code.zoia.org) and [zoia.org](http://zoia.org). It can be found on [Github](https://github.com/robertozoia/ristretto).  (I have switched both this blog and [zoia.org](http://zoia.org) to Ristretto.)
