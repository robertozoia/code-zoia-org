I somehow missed [The Making of Templar](http://jordanmechner.com/templarbook/), a free ebook by Jordan Mechner, LeUyen Pham, and Alex Puvilland.

Jordan Mechner is best known as the creator of great games like [Karateka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karateka_(video_game)) (1984), [Prince of Persia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_persia) (1989), [The Last Express](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Express) (1997)... Most of these games are now available for modern platforms like iOS and Android.

You can download the free ebook from [Jordan Mechner's page](http://jordanmechner.com/templarbook/).
