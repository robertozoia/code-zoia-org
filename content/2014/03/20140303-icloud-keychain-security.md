Apple has released an update to its [iOS Security](http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iOS_Security_Feb14.pdf) whitepaper.  Rich Mogull makes a good summary of the whitepaper, and explains why he thinks Apple has provided a way to make it impossible for a third party to obtain your iCloud Keychain passwords.

Worth reading.
