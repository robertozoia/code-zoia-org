Three posts by Marco Arment that you should read if you are an app developer: [Web Hosting for App Developers](http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers), [What Did I Just Learn?](http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/what-did-brent-learn), and [Wrong about home-hosting?](http://www.marco.org/2014/03/28/wrong-about-home-hosting).
